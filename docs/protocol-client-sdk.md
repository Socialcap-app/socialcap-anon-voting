# The Client SDK

The SDK is composed of the **packages for using the Semaphore protocol and the Relayer API**.

There are two groups of packages:

- **Semaphore packages**: These are the ones needed to use basic features of the Semaphore protocol.
- **Voting packages**: These are the ones needed by the App UI and are related to the Socialcap voting application protocol.
