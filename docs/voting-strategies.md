### Three elector types

Community

Validators

Auditors

### Two validations phases

**First phase:** 

Validation is done by electors from the community or the validators set.

| selected from  | random                                      | all                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Community      | min random members from the whole community | all members from the whole community   |
| Validators set | min random members from the validators set  | all validators from the validators set |
| Auditors set   | min random auditors from the auditors set   | all auditors from the auditors set     |

**Second phase:** 

If auditing enabled (frequency > 0) an extra validation is done by auditors from the auditors set

| selected from | random                                    | all                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Auditors set  | min random auditors from the auditors set | all auditors from the auditors set |
